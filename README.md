# Google FooBar Challenge
I infiltrated Commander Lambda's evil organization and will do my best to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet and rescue the important bunnies. Join me on this challenge Commander Google sent me on!

## Reflection
### Level 1 <br/>
Level 1 was one programming question with a time limit of 48 hours to complete. This level proved to be not very challenging as problems seemed as difficult as Leetcode Easy.
  
### Level 2 <br/>
Level 2 was two programming questions, each with a time limit of 72 hours. This level was slightly harder than level 1, but still seemed like Leetcode easy or maybe a little bit of medium at a stretch. Problems became much easier to solve once a mathematical pattern or sequence was found to represent what the question was asking. At this point, I was given a single use link to share with a friend so they can attempt the challenge.
  
### Level 3 <br/>
Level 3 was three programming questions each with a time limit of 96 hours. This level saw a sharp jump in difficulty. The first and third programming questions seemed to be Leetcode Medium questions with a strong emphasis on run time and optimization. The second part of level 3 took the most time to complete as I had to provide multiple different implementations before passing all the test cases. I started with constructing a binary tree using BFS to keep track of "generations", but this proved to be too computationally expensive. After reverse engineering the problem and going from "leaf" to "root", I realized there was a much simpler mathematical implementation. After implementing this code in Java, I did not pass the test cases as integers were too big, but after translation to python code, I was able to pass all the test cases. Upon completion of this level, I was asked to send my solutions to a Google Recruiter regarding career opportunities.

##### Stay tuned for updates!
